# About
The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

We will solve the 0-1 Knapsack type of this problem with the following methods:

- [x] Simulated Annealing

- [x] Genetic Algorithm

- [x] Ant Colony Algorithm

- [ ] Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm


# Information About Input Format
